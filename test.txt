Prologue
Yun Dong-ju

Until my dying day, looking up to the sky
I hope to have no shred of shame
Even in the gentle wind climbing a leaf
I suffered
With a heart singing of stars
I shall love every thing that is dying
And walk along the path
that is given to me

Tonight again, the stars are grazed by the wind
